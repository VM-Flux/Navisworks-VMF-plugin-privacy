    <hr />

    <h2>1) Scope</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy applies to <strong>VMFlux Obj Exporter</strong> (the “Plugin”), a desktop plugin used with Autodesk Navisworks.</p>
    <p>This policy explains what information we collect through the Plugin, how it is used, and how we handle information you may provide when contacting us for support.</p>

    <h2>2) Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>Through the Plugin</h3>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or sell personal information through the Plugin.</p>
    <p>The Plugin does <strong>not</strong> include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>analytics or usage tracking</li>
      <li>advertising trackers</li>
      <li>automatic crash reporting</li>
      <li>file-upload features to our servers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Through Support Communications</h3>
    <p>If you contact us by email for support, we may receive information you choose to provide, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>your name</li>
      <li>your email address</li>
      <li>the contents of your message</li>
      <li>attachments or screenshots you send voluntarily</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We use this information only to respond to your inquiry, provide support, and maintain a support history where reasonably necessary.</p>

    <h2>3) What the Plugin Does With Your Files</h2>
    <p>The Plugin converts your Navisworks data into OBJ format.</p>
    <p>This conversion is performed <strong>locally on your computer</strong>. Your model files, exported files, and project content are <strong>not uploaded to our servers</strong> by the Plugin.</p>
    <p>You remain responsible for how you store, share, and manage the files created using the Plugin.</p>

    <h2>4) Network Access and License / Entitlement Checks</h2>
    <p>The Plugin may connect to Autodesk services to verify that you have purchased, installed, or are authorized to use the Plugin through Autodesk channels, such as the Autodesk App Store.</p>
    <p>Any such network communication is used only for <strong>license or entitlement validation</strong>.</p>
    <p>We do not operate Autodesk’s systems, and Autodesk may process information in accordance with Autodesk’s own privacy practices. We do not receive your Autodesk account password, and we do not maintain our own user analytics database for entitlement checks.</p>

    <h2>5) Analytics, Telemetry, and Crash Reporting</h2>
    <p>The Plugin does <strong>not</strong> collect analytics or telemetry data.</p>
    <p>The Plugin does <strong>not</strong> automatically send us crash logs, diagnostics, or usage reports.</p>
    <p>If you choose to email us about an error or issue, any information you send is handled as a support communication under this policy.</p>

    <h2>6) Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not sell or share personal data collected through the Plugin because the Plugin does not collect personal data.</p>
    <p>If the Plugin performs entitlement validation, that interaction may involve Autodesk services as described above.</p>
    <p>We do not disclose your support emails or attachments to third parties except:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>where reasonably necessary to comply with legal obligations,</li>
      <li>to protect our rights or security, or</li>
      <li>with your permission.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7) Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Because the Plugin does not collect personal data, we do not maintain a plugin-user personal data database.</p>
    <p>If you contact us for support by email, we may retain that correspondence for as long as reasonably necessary to respond to your request, keep a support history, improve support quality, and meet legal, accounting, or security obligations.</p>
    <p><strong>Typical support retention period:</strong> 12 months after the last support interaction (unless a longer period is required for legal, security, or operational reasons).</p>

    <h2>8) Security</h2>
    <p>Because file conversion is performed locally, your files are generally kept within your own environment unless you choose to share them.</p>
    <p>We recommend that users:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>keep Autodesk Navisworks and related software up to date,</li>
      <li>maintain appropriate operating system and endpoint security,</li>
      <li>follow their organization’s IT and data-handling policies, and</li>
      <li>avoid sending sensitive project files by email unless necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>No method of electronic communication or storage is completely secure, but we aim to handle support communications responsibly and with reasonable care.</p>

    <h2>9) Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Depending on your location and applicable law, you may have rights regarding personal information you provide to us through support communications, such as the right to request access, correction, or deletion.</p>
    <p>To make a privacy-related request, please contact us using the details below.</p>

    <h2>10) Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.</p>
    <p>When we do, we will revise the <strong>“Last updated”</strong> date at the top of this page. The updated version will apply from the date it is posted.</p>
